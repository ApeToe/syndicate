# Syndicate RPG

Syndicate is a MMORPG gamemode for Garry's Mod. I released it commercially 3 years ago but didn't have much time to support it. It is over 35,000 lines of Lua code.

If you use this, I would appreciate you buying the **credit shop** addon [here](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/3915) - once hooked up to a donation system of your choice, your players will be able to purchase special items such as Weapon Reset Stones, ect.

If you don't want to do that but still want to help, please **Star** the repo.

## Installation

 1. Drag the gamemode to your gamemodes folder
 2. Copy `/syndicate/gamemode/config/config-default.lua` to `config.lua` so your config changes are not overridden every time your configuration.
 3. Edit the settings in `config.lua` - the defaults will work too
 4. Edit mysql.lua with your MySQL settings
 5. Done!

## Support
You can add me on Steam [here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/vrondakis) - leave a comment as to why you are adding.

## Tips

 - Don't rename the gamemode to something else or you will get less players - since servers are grouped by gamemode
 - If you wish to rename the gamemode to DarkRP so it shows under DarkRP, do the following: http://i.imgur.com/VjdSdy4.png
- Don't give yourself items/levels/ect, because if you do then players won't want to put time into getting things you got for nothing
