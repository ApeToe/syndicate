Syndicate RPG is a (RPG) gamemode for Garry's Mod. After being released commerically in 2016, it is now free to download!

If you use this, I would appreciate you buying the **credit shop** addon [here](https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/3915) - once hooked up to a donation system of your choice, your players will be able to purchase special items such as Weapon Reset Stones, ect.

If you don't want to do that but still want to help, please **Star** the repo.

## Installation
 1. Install DarkRP - this gamemode is derived from it
 2. Drag the gamemode to your gamemodes folder
 3. Copy `/syndicate/gamemode/config/config-default.lua` to `config.lua` so your config changes are not overridden every time you update.
 4. Edit the settings in `config.lua` - the defaults will work too
 5. Edit /syndicate/gamemode/config/mysql.lua with your MySQL settings
 6. Start and join your server, type 'fadmin setroot <yourname>' into the console to make yourself admin
 7. Press F4, go to admin, and setup your territories, spawns and buildings
 8. Use the admin tools to configure power sockets, capture points and cash spawns
 6. Done!

## Tips

 - Don't rename the gamemode to something else or you will get less players - since servers are grouped by gamemode
 - If you wish to rename the gamemode to DarkRP so it shows under DarkRP, do the following: http://i.imgur.com/VjdSdy4.png
- Don't give yourself items/levels/ect, because if you do then players won't want to put time into getting things you got for nothing
